\arguments{
\item{cells}{A segmentedCells or data frame that contains at least the variables x and y, giving the location of each cell, and cellType.}

\item{condition}{Vector of conditions to be tested corresponding to each image if cells is a data frame.}

\item{subject}{Vector of subject IDs corresponding to each image if cells is a data frame.}

\item{covariates}{Vector of covariate names that should be included in the mixed effects model as fixed effects.}

\item{from}{vector of cell types which you would like to compare to the to vector}

\item{to}{vector of cell types which you would like to compare to the from vector}

\item{dist}{The distance at which the statistic is obtained.}

\item{integrate}{Should the statistic be the integral from 0 to dist, or the value of the L curve at dist.}

\item{nsim}{Number of simulations to perform. If empty, the p-value from lmerTest is used.}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating whether to output messages.}

\item{...}{Other options to pass to bootstrap.}
}
\value{
Data frame of p-values.

\description{
Performs spatial tests on spatial cytometry data.

\examples{
data("melanomaResponders")

# Test with random effect for patient on only one pairwise combination of cell types.
spicy(melanomaResponders, condition = "condition", subject = "subject", from = "CD8+PD1+PDL1-", to = "CD8-PD1+PDL1+")
\dontrun{
# Test all pairwise combination of cell types without random effect of patient.
spicyTest <- spicy(melanomaResponders, condition = "condition")

 Test all pairwise combination of cell types with random effect of patient.
#spicy(melanomaResponders, condition = "condition", subject = "subject")

# Test all pairwise combination of cell types with random effect of patient using a bootstrap to calculate significance.
