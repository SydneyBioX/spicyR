Description: The spicyR package provides a framework for performing inference on changes in spatial relationships between pairs of cell types for cell-resolution spatial omics technologies. spicyR consists of three primary steps: (i) summarizing the degree of spatial localization between pairs of cell types for each image; (ii) modelling the variability in localization summary statistics as a function of cell counts and (iii) testing for changes in spatial localizations associated with a response variable.
